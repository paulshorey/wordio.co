# src/components modules  
  
Modules in this folder are regular React components. Nothing special. Some connect to Redux state. Some do not.  
  
### This will be refactored and separated later.  
  
However, for now, during active development, they go back and forth. Sometimes a "pure/dumb" component needs to connect to Redux, so becomes a "connected/smart" component, and vice versa!
