              Paul built some advanced admin tools to automate content editing. Samira used these tools to edit
              countless words and phrases. This made it possible for us to rearrange words and generate new phrases
              without accidentally creating awkward or offensive phrases. We're now utilizing this technology to
              generate domain name suggestions which otherwise only a human would have thought of.
